Who watches the watchers?
Needed something to write here, has anyone read Michio Kaku's "The Future of Humanity" recently? Our future sounds very exciting! Hopefully we can make technology that assists us rather than replaces us. Allowing humans to do what I believe they are best at which is create based on inspiration from our environment as we explore our five senses. Humanity has always looked for their creator. Have we ever looked in the mirror? We sculpt, we reproduce, code, build machines, and robots, etc. We are creators... not nessarily responsible for creating our own biological origin but everything after that we have created. Our destiny is our own. -Rdfk
